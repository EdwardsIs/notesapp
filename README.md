This is a simple appinventor project to allow users to perform simple crud operations on notes.


Within the NoteApp folder, there are two files.  There is a .aia file, which can be imported into appinventor (appinventor.mit.edu) to allow the project to be edited.  There is also a "dist" folder, which contains the compiled .apk file, which can be deployed on an android device.
